## Getting Started

The [GeoportalCMS documentation](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started) will walk you through some simple steps to get your [local environment set up](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/setting-up-your-environment) with the technology stack that runs GeoportalCMS (Node.js, MongoDB, ImageMagick) along with installing GeoportalCMS itself.

Then [create a new project](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/creating-your-first-project) on your computer and work on building your beautiful website.

The GeoportalCMS documentation will walk you through [editing page templates](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/editing-page-templates), [global content](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/global), [creating custom widgets](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/custom-widgets) and [navigation](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/building-navigation), along with [configuring reusable "pieces"](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/reusable-content-with-pieces) and [global settings](https://docs.geoportalcms.org/geoportal/tutorials/getting-started/settings). Plus, a whole lot more!
